# Machine-Learning-for-Predicting-Stocks
In this project, I experimented and learned how to use google's library tensor flow to predict stock prices with machine learning.
I used the RNN model and used it to predict the future stock prices of S&P Toyota stocks, which are also included in the repository.
However, other datasets like these can be found in Yahoo Finances.
